Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein have the respective meanings given them in the Company Terms of Service. Acquirer will provide Sub-merchant with certain payment processing (the “Services”) in accordance with the terms of this Merchant Agreement. In consideration of Sub-merchant's receipt of credit or debit card funded payments, and participation in programs affiliated with Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and certain similar entities (collectively, “Associations”), Sub-merchant is required to comply with the Rules as they pertain to applicable credit and debit card payments. In addition, if Sub-merchant meets certain requirements under the Operation Regulations or an Association or the Rules otherwise require, Sub-merchant may be required to enter into a direct relationship with an entity that is a Merchant of the Associations. By agreeing to the Company Terms of Service to which this Merchant Agreement is an exhibit (by “click through” agreement or otherwise), Sub-merchant has fulfilled this requirement, if and when applicable. However, Acquirer understands that Sub-merchant may have contracted with Company to obtain certain processing services and that Company may have agreed to be responsible to Sub-merchant for all or part of Sub-merchant's obligations contained herein. </p><br><p>NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals and of the mutual promises contained herein, the parties agree as follows: </p><br><ol><br><li>Certain Sub-merchant Responsibilities. Sub-merchant agrees to comply, and to cause third parties acting as Sub-merchant's agent (“Agents”) to comply, with the Associations' and other payment networks' by-laws, operating regulations and/or all other rules, policies and procedures, including but not limited to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, the VISA Cardholder Information Security Program, the MasterCard Site Data Protection Program, and any other program or requirement that may be published and/or mandated by the Associations or payment networks (collectively, “Rules”). Sub-merchant may review the VISA, MasterCard, and Discover websites for a copy of the Visa, MasterCard and Discover regulations. The websites are: <a href="http://usa.visa.com/merchants">http://usa.visa.com/merchants</a>; and <a href="http://www.mastercard.com/us/merchant/">http://www.mastercard.com/us/merchant/</a> and <a href="http://www.discovernetwork.com/merchants/">http://www.discovernetwork.com/merchants/</a>. Without limiting the foregoing, Sub-merchant agrees that it will fully comply with any and all anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including but not limited to the Bank Secrecy Act, the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the Federal Trade Commission. For purposes of this section, Agents include, but are not limited to, Sub-merchant's software providers and/or equipment providers. </li><br></ol><br><p>If so indicated in the Company Terms of Service, Sub-merchant may be a limited-acceptance merchant, which means that Sub-merchant has elected to accept only certain Visa and MasterCard card types (i.e., consumer credit, consumer debit, and commercial cards) and must display appropriate signage to indicated the same. Acquirer has no obligation other than those expressly provided under the Rules and applicable law as they may relate to limited acceptance. Sub-merchant, and not Acquirer, will be solely responsible for the implementation of its decision for limited acceptance, including but not limited to policing the card type(s) accepted at the point of sale. </p><br><p>Sub-merchant shall only complete sales transactions produced as the direct result of bona fide sales made by Sub-merchant to cardholders, and is expressly prohibited from presenting sales transactions which are produced as a result of sales made by any person or entity other than Sub-merchant, or for any purposes related to any illegal or prohibited activity, including but not limited to money-laundering or financing of terrorist activities.<br>Sub-merchant may set a minimum transaction amount to accept a card that provides access to a credit account, under the following conditions: i) the minimum transaction amount does not differentiate between card issuers; ii) the minimum transaction amount does not differentiate between MasterCard, Visa, or any other acceptance brand; and iii) the minimum transaction amount does not exceed ten dollars (or any higher amount established by the Federal Reserve). Sub-merchant may set a maximum transaction amount to accept a card that provides access to a credit account, under the following conditions: Sub-merchant is a i) department, agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government; ii) corporation owned or controlled by the U.S. government; or iii) Sub-merchant whose primary business is reflected by one of the following MCCs: 8220, 8244, 8249 - Schools, Trade or Vocational; and the maximum transaction amount does not differentiate between MasterCard, Visa, or any other acceptance brand. </p><br><ol start="2"><br><li><br><p>Sub-merchant Prohibitions. Sub-merchant must not i) require a cardholder to complete a postcard or similar device that includes the cardholder's account number, card expiration date, signature, or any other card account data in plain view when mailed, ii) add any tax to transactions, unless applicable law expressly requires that a Sub-merchant impose a tax (any tax amount, if allowed, must be included in the transaction amount and not collected separately), iii) request or use an account number for any purpose other than as payment for its goods or services, iv) disburse funds in the form of travelers checks if the sole purpose is to allow the cardholder to make a cash purchase of goods or services from Sub-merchant, v) disburse funds in the form of cash unless Sub-merchant is dispensing funds in the form of travelers checks, TravelMoney cards, or foreign currency (in such case, the transaction amount is limited to the value of the travelers checks, Travel Money cards, or foreign currency, plus any commission or fee charged by the Sub-merchant), or Sub-merchant is participating in a cash back service, vi) submit any transaction receipt for a transaction that was previously charged back to the Acquirer and subsequently returned to Sub-merchant, irrespective of cardholder approval, vii) accept a Visa consumer credit card or commercial Visa product issued by a U.S. issuer to collect or refinance an existing debt, viii) accept a card to collect or refinance an existing debt that has been deemed uncollectable, or ix) submit a transaction that represents collection of a dishonored check. Sub-merchant further agrees that, under no circumstance, will Sub-merchant store cardholder data in violation of the Laws or the Rules including but not limited to the storage of track-2 data. Neither Sub-merchant nor its Agent shall retain or store magnetic-stripe data subsequent to the authorization of a sales transaction. </p><br></li><br><li><br><p>Settlement. Upon receipt of Sub-merchant's sales data for card transactions, Acquirer will process Sub-merchant's sales data to facilitate the funds transfer between the various Associations and Sub-merchant. After Acquirer receives credit for such sales data, subject to the terms set forth herein, Acquirer will fund Sub-merchant directly to Sub-merchant's designated demand deposit account (“Sub-merchant-Owned Designated Account”) or, at Sub-merchant's request, to a third-party check writer's account.. Any dispute regarding amount of settlement shall be between Company and Sub-merchant. Any dispute regarding the receipt of settlement shall be between Acquirer and Sub-merchant. Acquirer will debit the Company Reserve Account for funds owed to Acquirer as a result of the Services provided hereunder, provided that Acquirer may also debit the Sub-merchant-Owned Designated Account for funds owed to Acquirer as a result of the Services provided hereunder. Further, if a cardholder disputes a transaction, if a transaction is charged back for any reason, or if Acquirer reasonably believes a transaction is unauthorized or otherwise unacceptable, the amount of such transaction may be charged back and debited from Sub-merchant or the Company reserve account. </p><br></li><br><li>Term and Termination. This Agreement shall be binding upon Sub-merchant upon Sub-merchant's acceptance (by “click through” agreement or otherwise). The term of this Agreement shall begin, and the terms of the Agreement shall be deemed accepted and binding upon Acquirer, on the date Acquirer accepts this Agreement by issuing a merchant identification number and shall be coterminous with Company's Terms of Service with Sub-merchant. </li><br></ol><br><p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Acquirer may immediately cease providing Services and/or terminate this Agreement without notice if (i) Sub-merchant or Company fails to pay any amount to Acquirer when due, (ii) in Acquirer's opinion, provision of a service to Sub-merchant or Company may be a violation of the Rules or any Laws, (iii) Acquirer believes that Sub-merchant has violated or is likely to violate the Rules or the Laws, (iv) Acquirer determines Sub-merchant poses a financial or regulatory risk to Acquirer or an Association, (v) Acquirer's agreement with Company terminates, (vi) any Association deregisters Company, (vii) Acquirer ceases to be a Merchant of the Associations or fails to have the required licenses, or (viii) Acquirer is required to do so by any of the Associations. </p><br><ol start="5"><br><li>Limits of Liability. Sub-merchant agrees to provide Acquirer, via a communication with Company, with written notice of any alleged beach by Acquirer of this Agreement, which notice will specifically detail such alleged breach, within thirty (30) days of the date on which the alleged breach first occurred. Failure to so provide notice shall be deemed an acceptance by Sub-merchant and a waiver of any and all rights to dispute such breach. </li><br></ol><br><p>EXCEPT FOR THOSE EXPRESS WARRANTIES MADE IN THIS AGREEMENT, ACQUIRER DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Sub-merchant's sole and exclusive remedy for any and all claims against Acquirer arising out of or in any way related to the transactions contemplated herein shall be termination of this Agreement. In the event that Sub-merchant has any claim arising in connection with the Services, rights, and/or obligations defined in this Agreement, Sub-merchant shall proceed against Company and not Acquirer, unless otherwise specifically set forth in the Rules. In no event shall Acquirer have any liability to Sub-merchant with respect to this Agreement or the Services. Sub-merchant acknowledges Acquirer is only providing this Agreement to assist in Company's processing relationship with Sub-merchant, that Acquirer is not liable for any action or failure to act by Company, and that Acquirer shall have no liability whatsoever in connection with any products or services provided to Sub-merchant by Company. If Company is unable to provide its services to Sub-merchant in connection with this Agreement and Acquirer elects to provide those services, directly, Sub-merchant acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Agreement will no longer apply and the terms of Acquirer's then current Bank Card Merchant Agreement, which would be provided to Sub-merchant, will govern Acquirer's relationship with Sub-merchant. If Company subsequently provides its services to Sub-merchant in connection with this Agreement, Acquirer will cease to provide such services after receipt of notice from Company and this Agreement will govern Acquirer's relationship with Sub-merchant. </p><br><ol start="6"><br><li>Miscellaneous. This Agreement is entered into, governed by, and construed pursuant to the laws of the State of Ohio without regard to conflicts of law provisions. This Agreement may not be assigned by Sub-merchant without the prior written consent of Acquirer. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, transferees and assignees. This Agreement is for the benefit of, and may be enforced only by, Acquirer and Sub-merchant and is not for the benefit of, and may not be enforced by, any other party. Acquirer may amend this Agreement upon notice to Sub-merchant in accordance with Acquirer's standard operating procedure. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal or invalid, such illegality or invalidity of that provision will not affect any of the remaining provisions and this Agreement will be construed as if such provision is not contained in the Agreement. “Merchant Bank” as used in this Agreement shall mean a Merchant of VISA, MasterCard and/or Discover, as applicable, that provides sponsorship services in connection with this Agreement. As of the commencement of this Agreement, Merchant Bank shall be Fifth Third Bank, an Ohio Banking Corporation, located in Cincinnati, OH 45263. The Merchant Bank is a party to this Agreement. The Merchant Bank may be changed, and its rights and obligations assigned to another party by Acquirer at any time without notice to Sub-merchant.</li><br></ol><p class="terms__header-grey">Exhibit B - American Express Card Acceptance and Brand Requirements</p><p class="terms__text">In the event Merchant accepts American Express, the Merchant agreement must contain the following terms and conditions.</p><br><p>The following will only apply to Merchant’s participation in the American Express Program.

ARBITRATION AGREEMENT (as to Claims involving American Express).</p><p class="terms__text">In the event that Merchant or Processor is not able to resolve a Claim against American Express, or a claim against Processor or any other entity that American Express has a right to join, this section explains how Claims may be resolved through arbitration. Merchant or American Express may elect to resolve any Claim by binding individual arbitration. Claims will be decided by a neutral arbitrator.</p><br><p>If arbitration is elected by any party, neither Merchant nor Processor nor American Express will have the right to litigate or have a jury trial on that Claim in court. Further, Merchant, Processor, and American Express will not have the right to participate in a class action or in a representative capacity or in a group of persons alleged to be similarly situated pertaining to any Claim subject to arbitration under this Agreement. Arbitration procedures are generally simpler than the rules in court. An arbitrator’s decisions are final and binding, and the arbitrator’s final decision on a Claim generally is enforceable as a court order with very limited review by a court. Other rights Merchant, Processor, or American Express would have in court may also not be available in arbitration.</p><br><p>i. Initiation of Arbitration.  Claims may be referred to either JAMS or AAA, as selected by the party electing arbitration.  Claims will be resolved pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement and the selected organization’s rules in effect when the Claim is filed, except where those rules conflict with this Agreement. Contact JAMS or AAA to begin an arbitration or for other information. Claims may be referred to another arbitration organization if all parties agree in writing, if American Express selects the organization and Merchant selects the other within 30 days thereafter or if an arbitrator is appointed pursuant to section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16 (FAA). Any arbitration hearing will take place in the federal judicial district where Merchant’s headquarters is located or New York, NY, at Merchant’s election.</p><br><p>ii. Limitations on Arbitration. If any party elects to resolve a Claim by arbitration, that Claim will be arbitrated on an individual basis. No Claim is to be arbitrated on a class or purported representative basis or on behalf of the general public or other persons allegedly similarly situated. The arbitrator’s authority is limited to Claims between Merchant, Processor, and American Express. An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it will apply only to the specific case brought by Merchant, Processor or American Express and cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award as between Merchant, Processor and American Express. This prohibition is intended to, and does, preclude Merchant from participating in any action by any trade association or other organization against American Express. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, if any portion of these Limitations on Arbitration is found invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Arbitration Agreement (other than this sentence) will not apply, except that Merchant, Processor, and American Express do not waive the right to appeal that decision.</p><br><p>iii. Previously Filed Claims/No Waiver. Merchant, Processor, or American Express may elect to arbitrate any Claim that has been filed in court at any time before trial has begun or final judgment has been entered on the Claim. Merchant, Processor, or American Express may choose to delay enforcing or to not exercise rights under this Arbitration Agreement, including the right to elect to arbitrate a claim, without waiving the right to exercise or enforce those rights on any other occasion. For the avoidance of any confusion, and not to limit its scope, this section applies to any class-action lawsuit relating to the “Honor All Cards,” “non-discrimination,” or “no steering” provisions of the American Express Merchant Regulations, or any similar provisions of any prior American Express Card acceptance agreement that was filed against American Express prior to the Effective Date of the Agreement to the extent that such claims are not already subject to arbitration pursuant to a prior agreement between Merchant and American Express.</p><br><p>iv.  Arbitrator’s Authority . The arbitrator will have the power and authority to award any relief that would have been available in court and that is authorized under this Agreement. The arbitrator has no power or authority to alter the Agreement or any of its separate provisions, including this arbitration agreement.</p><br><p>v. Split Proceedings for Equitable Relief. Merchant, Processor, or American Express may seek equitable relief in aid of arbitration prior to arbitration on the merits if necessary to preserve the status quo pending completion of the arbitration. This section shall be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction, and the party seeking enforcement is entitled to seek an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs to be paid by the party against whom enforcement is ordered.</p><br><p>vi. Small Claims. American Express will not elect arbitration for any Claim Merchant properly files in a small claims court so long as the Claim seeks individual relief only and is pending only in that court.</p><br><p>vii. Governing Law/Arbitration Procedures/Entry of Judgment. This Arbitration Agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and is governed by the FAA. The arbitrator shall apply New York law and applicable statutes of limitations and honor claims of privilege recognized by law.  The arbitrator shall apply the rules of the arbitration organization selected, as applicable to matters relating to evidence and discovery, not federal or any state rules of procedure or evidence, provided that any party may ask the arbitrator to expand discovery by making a written request, to which the other parties will have 15 days to respond before the arbitrator rules on the request. If Merchant’s Claim is for $10,000 or less, Merchant may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the rules of the selected arbitration organization. At the timely request of a party, the arbitrator will provide a written opinion explaining his/her award. The arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding, except for any rights of appeal provided by the FAA. Judgment on an award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any state or federal court in the federal judicial district where Merchant’s headquarters or Merchant’s assets are located.</p><br><p>viii. Confidentiality. The arbitration proceeding and all information submitted, relating to or presented in connection with or during the proceeding, shall be deemed confidential information not to be disclosed to any person not a party to the arbitration. All communications, whether written or oral, made in the course of or in connection with the Claim and its resolution, by or on behalf of any party or by the arbitrator or a mediator, including any arbitration award or judgment related thereto, are confidential and inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment or estoppel, in any other litigation or proceeding; provided, however, that evidence shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable solely as a result of its use in the arbitration.</p><br><p>ix. Costs of Arbitration Proceedings. Merchant will be responsible for paying Merchant’s share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing or other fees), but only up to the amount of the filing fees Merchant would have incurred if Merchant had brought a claim in court. American Express will be responsible for any additional arbitration fees. At Merchant’s written request, American Express will consider in good faith making a temporary advance of Program Merchant’s share of any arbitration fees, or paying for the reasonable fees of an expert appointed by the arbitrator for good cause.</p><br><p>x. Additional Arbitration Awards. If the arbitrator rules in Merchant’s favor against American Express for an amount greater than any final settlement offer American Express made before arbitration, the arbitrator’s award will include: (1) any money to which Merchant is entitled as determined by the arbitrator, but in no case less than $5,000; and (2) any reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expert and other witness fees incurred by Merchant.</p><br><p>xi. Definitions.  For purposes of this section xii. only, (i) American Express includes its Affiliates, licensees, predecessors, successors, or assigns, any purchasers of any receivables, and all agents, directors, and representatives of any of the foregoing, (ii) Merchant includes Merchant’s Affiliates, licensees, predecessors, successors, or assigns, any purchasers of any receivables and all agents, directors, and representatives of any of the foregoing, and (iii) Claim means any allegation of an entitlement to relief, whether damages, injunctive or any other form of relief, against American Express or against Processor or any other entity that American Express has the right to join, including, a transaction using an American Express product or network or regarding an American Express policy or procedure.</p><p class="terms__header-grey">F.
