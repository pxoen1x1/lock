  <h2>Collection of Your Information</h2>
    <p><i>Lockheal Platform Registration and Profile.</i> Much of the information collected by Lockheal about Users is information provided by Users themselves at the time they create an account on the Lockheal Platform or in creating or modifying a user profile. That information includes a User's name, email address, and phone number. If you register via a social networking site such as Facebook, we collect information from your Facebook profile such as name, gender, profile photo, and friends. Service Providers additionally provide company name, business address, license information, bank account number, and bank routing data during the registration process. Additional Service Provider information may be required in some jurisdictions. Information provided by Service Providers is shared with our partners to run background checks and verify credentials. Users may provide additional information such as home address, personal interests, business details, and work history in their user profile.</p>
    <p><i>Credit Card and Bank information.</i> During account creation or at a later time you may provide or change credit or debit card information to pay for Services. A third party payment provider service will receive such information. You may optionally for your convenience elect to save your payment information to your profile. We do not store your payment information on our servers unless you elect to save your payment information to your profile. Service Providers provide bank information including account numbers and routing numbers to enable payment to their accounts.</p>
    <p><i>Location Information.</i> We receive your location when you access the Lockheal Platform on your mobile device. We may receive location regardless of whether the Lockheal Platform is accessed via an application running in the background or foreground. Accessing the Lockheal Platform from other network-connected devices may also result in us receiving your location information. We may also receive labels you provide for certain locations, for example for setting a location where Services are to be provided. We use your location information to help connect Users, particularly Customers with Service Providers during initial introduction and when a Service Provider travels to a Customer location to perform Services. You can prevent sharing of your location by changing settings on your device. However, features or functionality of the Lockheal Platform may be limited when you do not share your location.</p>
    <p><i>Device Information.</i> We collect information from Users’ devices, including device type and identifiers, telecommunication carrier, browser type, device operating system version, installed applications, mobile advertising identifiers, and push notification tokens. If you create your Lockheal account via a social networking account such as Facebook, we may receive your account identifier for that account. We may collect sensor data, for example acceleration and orientation data, from Service Providers’ mobile devices to improve the accuracy of location determinations or for analyzing device usage patterns.</p>
    <p><i>Usage.</i> We collect information about your interactions with the Lockheal Platform including pages you visit, content you view, and dates and times of your visits and viewings. We use this information to understand your use of the Lockheal Platform, for example to help us enhance the usage experience of you and other Users.</p>

We further use the information we collect to communicate with Users including for customer support and marketing and promotional purposes. We may communicate via email, text, push notifications, or other manner.

    <p>Information provided by Service Providers is further used in checking the background and licensing of Service Providers, notifying Service Providers regarding the status of their Service Provider account, and notifying Service Providers of changes to the commission schedule.</p>
  <h2>How Your Information is Shared</h2>
    <p><i>Sharing between Users generally.</i> Certain User information collected from Users is disclosed as a matter of course as a result of those Users' use of the Lockheal Platform, for example in the use of discussion groups and online forums.</p>
    <p><i>Sharing between Customer and Service Provider.</i> Customers looking for a Service Provider are enabled to see profile information of the Service Providers they view on the Lockheal Platform, which information can include the name, photos, company name, business address, reviews, ratings, and information added by the Service Provider to their profile. Service providers can see the name and other information provided in the profiles of Customers who contact them. Customers can at any time delete additional information they added to their profiles so it cannot be seen by Service Providers. Service Providers can see the locations for performing services as provided by the Customers, and Customers can see Service Providers vehicle location in real-time as the Service Provider drives to the Customer location. Feedback and ratings provided by a Customer are available to the Service Provider and other Users. Feedback and ratings are de-identified, but that does not guarantee a Service Provider will not be able to discern who provided particular feedback or ratings.</p>

Such services may include for example performing background checks, identity and licensing verification, payment processing, and providing insurance to Lockheal. We may share your information with third parties running other sites, services, or platforms which you may connect with through the Lockheal Platform. Lockheal is not under the control of such third parties or their offerings. You should read the privacy polices of such third parties before connecting to their sites, services, or platforms, as Lockheal does not control their privacy policies.
