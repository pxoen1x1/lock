  <h3>16. Arbitration and Dispute Resolution Agreement</h3>
    <p>Please Read This Following Clause Carefully-It May Significantly Affect Your Legal Rights. Including Your Right to File a Lawsuit in Court
      16.1 Initial Dispute Resolution. We are available by email at info@lockheal.com to address any concerns you may have regarding your use of the Lockheal Platform. Most concerns may be quickly resolved in this manner. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.<br>
      16.2 Agreement to Binding Arbitration. If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to section 16.1 above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration. All claims arising out of or relating to this agreement (including its formation, performance and breach), the parties' relationship with each other and/or your use of the Lockheal Platform shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the provisions of AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction, subject to review in accordance with applicable statutes governing arbitration awards. The interpretation and enforcement of this agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. THE AAA'S RULES GOVERNING THE ARBITRATION MAY BE ACCESSED AT WWW.ADR.ORG OR BY CALLING THE AAA AT 1.800.778.7879. TO THE EXTENT THE FILING FEE FOR THE ARBITRATION EXCEEDS THE COST OF FILING A LAWSUIT, WE WILL PAY THE ADDITIONAL COST. A REQUEST FOR PAYMENT OF FEES SHOULD BE SUBMITTED TO AAA ALONG WITH YOUR FORM FOR INITIATING THE ARBITRATION, AND WE WILL MAKE ARRANGEMENTS TO PAY ALL NECESSARY FEES DIRECTLY TO AAA. IF THE ARBITRATOR FINDS THE ARBITRATION TO BE NON-FRIVOLOUS, WE WILL PAY ALL OF THE ACTUAL FILING AND ARBITRATOR FEES FOR THE ARBITRATION, PROVIDED YOUR CLAIM DOES NOT EXCEED $5,000. THE ARBITRATION RULES ALSO PERMIT YOU TO RECOVER ATTORNEY'S FEES IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT, ABSENT THIS MANDATORY PROVISION, THEY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. THEY FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION COULD EXCEED THE COSTS OF LITIGATION AND THE RIGHT TO DISCOVERY MAY BE MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION THAN IN COURT.<br>
      16.3 Class Action and Class Arbitration Waiver. The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above in section 16.2 shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.<br>
      16.4 Exception - Small Claims Court Claims. Notwithstanding the parties' agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.<br>
      16.5 30 Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to optout and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in sections 16.2, 16.3, and 16.4 by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested to the following address: Lockheal Arbitration Opt-Out, 276 Fifth Avenue, Suite 704-096, New York, NY 10001. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of registering to use the Lockheal Platform, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those sections. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.<br>
      16.6 Exclusive Venue for Litigation. To the extent that the arbitration provisions set forth in section 16.2 do not apply, the parties agree that any litigation between them shall be filed exclusively in state or federal courts located in Delaware (except for small claims court actions which may be brought in the county where you reside). The parties expressly consent to exclusive jurisdiction in Delaware for any litigation other than small claims court actions.</p>
